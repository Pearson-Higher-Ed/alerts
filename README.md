Welcome Origami Developer! This is the starting project template for a standalone Origami v2 component.

1. Follow these [directions](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-all) to stop
 manually authenticating to GitHub on every network request. This enables the use of automated npm scripts.

2. Create your new repository in GitHub (open source - default) or, if necessary, Pearson BitBucket (private source). In
 order to be able to create a GitHub repo, send a request to pearson-design-accelerator@pearson.com to be invited to 
github.com/Pearson-Higher-Ed.

3. Perform these steps in your development environment:  
	1. git clone https://github.com/Pearson-Higher-Ed/component-archetype.git [name_of_your_new_component]  
	2. cd [name_of_your_new_component]  
    3. git remote set-url origin [url_of_new_component_repository]  
    4. git remote -v  
  
4. Once you've verified that the remote origin now looks correct for your repo, do the initial push:

    git push -u origin master

5. After completing these steps, discard this README and rename [README.main.md](README.main.md) as "README.md" for your project.
