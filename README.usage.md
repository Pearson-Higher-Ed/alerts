# Usage

This project supports [Node v4+](https://nodejs.org) and npm 2+ installed in your development toolchain.

Install and save in your package.json:

    npm install @pearson-components/[component-name] --save

## External Dependencies

React and ReactDOM (v0.14 or v15) are external dependencies required to use this component. They are npm-installable or 
available from a third-party [CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react/).

This component targets the styling in the [Pearson Elements SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pearson-elements).

## Cross-browser Compatibility

The following [Polyfill.io](https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples) service is recommended for consuming this 
component cross-browser:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.js?features=CustomEvent,Intl.~locale.en,Intl.~locale.fr"></script>
```

The CustomEvent polyfill is for Internet Explorer, and the Intl.js polyfill is for Safari. As you support more languages,
add them to the list of features requested.

If your browser already supports a feature, this service automatically optimizes and does not bring down unnecessary code.

## How to Consume in an Application

See the /demo directory for example usage.

The transpiled, minified bundle will be available in /node_modules/@pearson-components in the component 
/build directory after you have npm installed this component in your project.
