# Usage

You must have [Node v4+](https://nodejs.org) installed in your development toolchain.

Install from npm and save in your package.json:

    npm install @pearson-components/[component-name] --save

## External Dependencies

React and ReactDOM (v0.14 or v15) are external dependencies required to use this component. They are npm-installable or 
available from third-party CDNs.

This component targets the styling in the Pearson Elements SDK, which is available in npm as "pearson-elements".

## Polyfills

The following [Polyfill.io](https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/docs/examples) features are recommended for consuming this 
component cross-browser:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.js?features=CustomEvent,Intl.~locale.en,Intl.~locale.fr"></script>
```

The CustomEvent polyfill is for Internet Explorer, and the Intl.js polyfill is for Safari. As you support more languages,
add them to the list of polyfills. 

If your browser already supports a feature, the service will automatically optimize and leave out unnecessary polyfills.

## How to Consume in an Application

See the /demo directory for example usage.
     
### Bundle (Simplest)

The transpiled, minified bundle will be available in /node_modules in the component /build directory.
